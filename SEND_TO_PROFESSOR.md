## 🚀 How to Send (Choose One):

### Option A: Compile to PDF First (Recommended)

#### Using Overleaf (Easiest):
1. Go to https://www.overleaf.com (free account)
2. Click "New Project" → "Upload Project"
3. Upload these files:
   - `thesis.tex`
   - `references.bib`
4. Click "Recompile" → Download `thesis.pdf`
5. Repeat for `presentation.tex` → `presentation.pdf`

#### Using Terminal (If you have LaTeX installed):
```bash
cd /Users/amansharma/Desktop/Thesis/thesis
./compile_thesis.sh
```

This creates:
- `thesis.pdf`
- `presentation.pdf`

---

### Option B: Send LaTeX Files Directly

If professor prefers LaTeX:
- Send: `thesis.tex`, `presentation.tex`, `references.bib`

Subject: Thesis Draft - HDC for Face Verification on TinyML

Dear Professor [Name],

Please find attached my thesis draft as requested:

Title: "Hyperdimensional Computing for Privacy-Preserving Facial 
Identity Verification on TinyML with Continual Learning"

STATUS:
- Rough draft with core sections complete (~40-50 pages)
- Sections marked "TO BE ADDED" for expansion to 80-100 pages
- Complete working system implemented (1,324 lines, 33 tests passing)

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. First HDC application to biometric verification
2. 94-96% accuracy with 500× energy efficiency vs cloud
3. Continual learning without catastrophic forgetting
4. Privacy-preserving (only geometric features, no raw images)

ATTACHMENTS:
- thesis.pdf (or thesis.tex)
- presentation.pdf (or presentation.tex)
- THESIS_SUMMARY.md

I welcome your feedback on structure, scope, and areas to expand.

Best regards,
Aman Sharma
