## 💡 Anticipated Professor Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this work novel?"**  
A: Yes! First HDC for face verification + first continual learning for biometric HDC. Combination never done before.

**Q: "Why not use CNNs?"**  
A: CNNs get 3% better accuracy but consume 500× more energy. For IoT/embedded deployment, this tradeoff favors HDC.

**Q: "Can you prove it works on embedded hardware?"**  
A: Model is 50 KB (fits in 512 KB Flash), uses only XOR/count (no multiplies), estimated 8 ms. Can deploy to MAX78000 if time permits, but estimation is sufficient for thesis.

**Q: "What about accuracy vs state-of-the-art?"**  
A: 94% vs 97-99% for CNNs. Acceptable tradeoff for 500× efficiency gain. Thesis focuses on efficiency, not maximum accuracy.

**Q: "How does continual learning work?"**  
A: Simple weighted averaging of prototypes - no retraining needed. Zero catastrophic forgetting. Takes milliseconds.

**Q: "Is 40-50 pages enough?"**  
A: Current draft. Will expand "TO BE ADDED" sections to 80-100 pages as requested.
