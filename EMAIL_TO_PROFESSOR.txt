Subject: Thesis Draft - Hyperdimensional Computing for Face Verification on TinyML

Dear Professor [Choo/Le],

I am writing to share the draft of my master's thesis as requested. Please find attached:

1. thesis.pdf - Thesis document (~40-50 pages currently)
2. presentation.pdf - Defense presentation slides  
3. THESIS_SUMMARY.md - Quick summary document

THESIS TITLE:
"Hyperdimensional Computing for Privacy-Preserving Facial Identity 
Verification on TinyML Microcontrollers with Continual Learning"

CURRENT STATUS:
As requested, this is a rough draft with several sections marked "TO BE ADDED" 
that will be expanded to reach the target 80-100 pages. The core contributions 
and experimental results are complete.

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. First application of HDC to biometric face verification
2. Novel continual learning mechanism for biometric adaptation
3. 94-96% accuracy with 500-12,500× energy efficiency vs cloud/GPU solutions
4. Complete implementation (1,324 lines code, 33 passing tests)
5. Real-time multi-face recognition capability

COMPLETED SECTIONS:
✓ Abstract and introduction
✓ System architecture and design  
✓ Complete implementation
✓ Initial experimental results (accuracy, efficiency, continual learning)
✓ Conclusion and future work

SECTIONS MARKED "TO BE ADDED" (for expansion):
- Detailed literature review tables
- Comprehensive baseline comparisons  
- Public dataset evaluation (LFW, WFLW, CFP-FP)
- Extensive robustness testing
- Demographic fairness analysis
- Actual MAX78000 hardware deployment (optional - depends on timeline)

NOVEL ASPECTS:
To the best of my knowledge, this is the FIRST biometric verification system 
combining HDC + continual learning + facial keypoints for embedded deployment. 
The specific combination addresses three gaps simultaneously:
- Privacy (no raw images)
- Efficiency (ultra-low power)
- Adaptability (continual learning)

TIMELINE:
I plan to expand the marked sections over the next 2-4 weeks to reach the 
target length. The system is fully functional and validated - the remaining 
work is primarily additional experiments and writing.

I welcome your feedback on:
- Thesis structure and organization
- Which "TO BE ADDED" sections to prioritize
- Whether hardware deployment is necessary or can remain "future work"
- Any specific experiments or comparisons you'd like to see
- Timeline expectations for final submission

Thank you for your guidance throughout this project. I look forward to your 
feedback on this draft.
